### Topic: The different types of Database Users and Database Administrators
----

I'm familiar with 7 types of database users namely:

1.Database Administrator:
From my understanding DBAs can be compared to an Engineer(creating structure of the database,designing and maintaining systems)
It can be even compared to a Doctor(Checks the database's Health,Plans for the worstcase scenarios and assures everything's fine)
Not only that but also a Gate keeper(Controlling the access to the database,letting only the authorised ones to enter and Security)

2.Naive Users:
Everyday users who rely on database applications and user-friendly interfaces without needing technical knowledge.

3.System Analyst:
They act as a bridge between users and database to ensure the needs are satisfied.

4.Sophisticated Users:
Professionals who are proficient with databases and has a deeper understanding in computer science.
ex:Software Developer

5.Database Designers:
They design the structure for the database considering user requirements.

6.Application Programmers:
They develop and maintain software apps that interact with databases.

7.Casual Users / Temporary Users:
They are occasional users who access the database only when needed.

8.Specialized Users:
Similar to Sophisticated Users possessing a deeper understanding of databases but they operate within a specialized domain,focusing on specific tasks industries or database apps.

During the flipped class session, I took notes and researched the various types of database users for the first 15 minutes. Then, we discussed and shared our own perspectives.

Flipped class can be improved by offering a variety of learning materials, like watching videos, listening to podcasts, or looking at real-life examples, so that everyone can find something that works best for them.
