# TryHackMe - Agent Sudo
You found a secret server located under the deep sea. Your task is to hack inside the server and reveal the truth.

# Task 1: Author note

Welcome to another THM exclusive CTF room. Your task is simple, capture the flags just like the other CTF room. Have Fun!

If you are stuck inside the black hole, post on the forum or ask in the TryHackMe discord.

# Task 2: Enumerate
Enumerate the machine and get all the important information.

    sudo nmap -sS -A -T4 -oN nmap.txt 10.10.219.145

The scan identified three services running on the target system:

*Port 21: This port is used by FTP, and the target is running vsftpd 3.0.3.
Port 22: This port is used by SSH, with the target running OpenSSH 7.6p1. Additionally, the target operating system is Ubuntu.
Port 80: This port is used by the web server, and the target is running Apache 2.4.29.*

The web application instructed us to change the browser's user-agent to our codename. I was initially confused, but I noticed that one of the agent codenames is "R." So, I set the user-agent to "R."

In Firefox, you can change the user-agent using this add-on:

[User-Agent Switcher](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/uaswitcher/)

From the preferences menu, I created a new custom user-agent, set its value to "R," and refreshed the page.

The output changed to show a warning and revealed that there are 26 agents, including Agent R. It then struck me that the agent codenames correspond to the 26 letters of the English alphabet.

I changed the user-agent to "A" and refreshed the page, but this did not change the content, implying that the site was not intended for Agent A.

This process needs to be repeated until the correct agent is found. The testing can be automated using Burp Suite with a wordlist containing the 26 letters of the alphabet.

When I changed the user-agent to "C" and refreshed the site, I was redirected to a new page.

Agent C, also known as Chris, needs to convey information to Agent J. Additionally, it has been disclosed that the password employed by Agent C is not secure.

## Questions
How many open ports?

    3

How do you redirect yourself to a secret page?

    user-agent

What is the agentâ€™s name?

    Chris

# Task 3: Hash cracking and brute-force
You know the drill.

Done enumerate the machine? Time to brute your way out.

Given that Agent C, known as Chris, has a weak password, it's plausible that employing a dictionary brute-force attack could uncover the credentials for the FTP service.

![alt text](../assets/lib/Screenshot_2024-05-19_13-00-52.png)
The password for Chris to log in via FTP is "crystal."

The "To_agentJ.txt" file holds instructions from Agent C to Agent J regarding the discovery of their password. Agent J is directed that the alien images are counterfeit and harbor concealed information.

The "cutie.png" file contains two embedded compressed files. The first archive within the image is compressed using Zlib. The second archive is a .zip file that is encrypted (password protected). Moreover, it's apparent that the .zip file contains a "To_agentR.txt" file. Since our objective is to obtain the .txt file, we must extract the second archive from the image.

To achieve this, we can utilize the `dd` utility, which allows us to extract bytes of data from a file and save it as a new file. To extract the Zip archive from the image, we need the starting and ending byte positions. According to the detection by binwalk, the archive starts at byte 34562 and ends at byte 34820. Additionally, binwalk has identified that the Zip archive footer is 22 bytes long. This indicates that the total size of the archive is (34820 - 34562) + 22 = 280 bytes.

To crack the password of the archive, it's necessary to write the hash of the file into a separate file. This hash can then be used with the John the Ripper tool to conduct a dictionary brute-force attack.

    zip2john secret.zip > hash.txt

    john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt

The password for the archive is "alien." Decompress the archive to access its contents.

    7z x secret.zip

The contents of the "To_agentR.txt" file consist of instructions from Agent R to Agent C. It directs Agent C to transmit an image to a specific destination. However, the destination mentioned in the message seems to be encoded using a cipher.

![alt text](../assets/lib/Screenshot_2024-05-19_13-42-14.png)

The CyberChef magic function detected that the text is encoded using Base64 encoding. Agent R wants Agent C to send the images to Area51.

Furthermore, considering a prior instruction informing Agent C that all of the alien images contain hidden data, and given that only the "cutie.png" image has been utilized thus far, it's reasonable to assume that the "cute-alien.jpg" image also contains hidden instructions.

Upon using steghide on the image, a prompt for a password is displayed, confirming the presence of hidden data.

    steghide extract -sf cute-alien.jpg

![alt text](../assets/lib/Screenshot_2024-05-19_13-47-11.png)

Using "Area51" as the password, the hidden content is successfully extracted from the "cute-alien.jpg" image.

Agent C (Chris) has a message for Agent J (James). The password for James is "hackerrules!".

# Task 4: Capture the user flag
The home directory contains a file named "user_flag.txt" which holds the user flag. Next, the incident depicted in the "Alien_autospy.jpg" file needs to be identified. You can download the image onto your system using SCP.

    scp james@10.10.226.220:~/Alien_autospy.jpg .

After uploading the image to Google Image search, multiple news articles are retrieved. The one from Fox News refers to it as the Roswell alien autopsy incident.

# Task 5: Privilege escalation
Enough with the extraordinary stuff? Time to get real.

I examined whether any binaries with unusual permissions, particularly those with the SUID bit set, were present, but none were found. Subsequently, I listed all processes running as root on the system, and upon inspection, the running processes appeared to be normal and in order.

    find / -type f -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -lah {} + 2> /dev/null

    ps aux | grep root

    sudo -l

These commands are used to:

* List binaries with the SUID bit set (find / -type f -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -lah {} + 2> /dev/null).

* List processes running as root (ps aux | grep root).

* Check the sudo permissions of the current user (sudo -l).

The sudoers file indicates that Agent J can execute the /bin/bash command as any user except the root user. This configuration is unusual and uncommon.

![alt text](../assets/lib/Screenshot_2024-05-19_14-04-43.png)
The system is utilizing version 1.8.21p2 of the sudo utility. A brief search online indicates that this version of the binary contains a vulnerability that can be exploited to obtain root access.
