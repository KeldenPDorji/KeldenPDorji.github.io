## Pre-Requisites
Linux Command Line: Essential for navigating the VM environment and executing commands.
Network Fundamentals: Understanding of ports, protocols, and traffic data is crucial for grasping Snort's functionality.

## Introduction to Snort
Overview: Snort is an open-source, rule-based NIDS/NIPS developed by Martin Roesch and maintained by the Cisco Talos team. It's globally recognized for its effectiveness in detecting and preventing network intrusions.

## Setting Up the Environment
VM Deployment: Deploy the provided VM in split-screen view. Use the "Show Split View" button if the VM doesn't load immediately. The VM starts offline, but you'll use the traffic-generator.sh script to generate traffic for exercises.

## Interactive Material and VM
Task-Exercises Folder: Upon VM startup, locate the "Task-Exercises" folder on the Desktop. This folder contains individual exercise folders with pcap, log, and rule files for hands-on practice. Also, find sample configuration and rule files under "Config-Sample" for reference.

## Using the traffic-generator.sh Script
Generating Traffic: The traffic-generator.sh script triggers traffic to the Snort interface. Run sudo./traffic-generator.sh to start. The script prompts you to select an exercise type and automatically opens another terminal to display the output. Ensure you start the Snort instance and wait for the script to finish before stopping the traffic.

## Practical Application and Learning Environment
Real-Time Threat Detection: Learn to use Snort for real-time threat detection by analyzing live network traffic.
Analyzing Recorded Traffic: Practice analyzing pcap files using Snort’s pattern matcher to detect network anomalies and threats.
Identifying Anomalies: Enhance your skills in identifying unusual network activities and potential security threats using Snort.

## Detailed Exercises
IDS/IPS Mode: Explore Snort's IDS/IPS mode, which includes various alert modes and the ability to drop packets. Experiment with different alert modes (cmg, fast, full, none) and understand their implications.
Testing User-Created Rules: Run Snort with only rules without a configuration file to test user-created rules. This mode provides less performance but is useful for rule testing.
Data Acquisition (DAQ) Modules: Activate DAQ modules and use the afpacket module to use Snort as an IPS. This involves editing the snort.conf file or running Snort with specific parameters.

## Conclusion
Summary: The "Snort" room on TryHackMe offers a comprehensive and interactive journey through the world of Snort, covering its origins, operating modes, rule structure, and configuration. By the end of this guide, learners will have a thorough understanding of how to use Snort effectively for network security and intrusion detection/prevention. This hands-on approach, combined with the provided VM environment, makes it an invaluable resource for anyone looking to master Snort and enhance their network security skills.

## Establishing the Connection
Before diving into the room, I had already established a connection to the TryHackMe site through OpenVPN, a secure method that allowed me to access the platform without compromising on security. This step was crucial as it ensured that all my interactions with the platform were encrypted and secure.

## Introduction to Network Security and Traffic Analysis
As I embarked on this journey, I was introduced to the vast domain of network security, which encompasses a wide array of operations aimed at protecting data, applications, devices, and systems connected to a network. Traffic analysis, a subdomain of network security, caught my attention as it focuses on investigating network data to identify problems and anomalies. This room promised to cover the foundations of these disciplines, setting the stage for a deeper exploration into traffic/packet analysis.

## Core Areas of Exploration
Authentication and Authorization: I delved into the mechanisms that verify the identity of users and devices accessing the network, ensuring they have the appropriate permissions. This is a fundamental aspect of network security, preventing unauthorized access.

Tools, Technologies, and Methodologies: I explored the range of tools and technologies used in network security, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and data loss prevention (DLP) solutions. These tools play a vital role in safeguarding the network from various threats.

Control Levels: Understanding the three basic control levels of Network Security—Physical, Technical, and Administrative—was essential. Each level contributes uniquely to the overall security posture of the network.

## Approaches to Network Security
Access Control: I learned about the mechanisms for controlling access to network resources, including firewall protection, network access control (NAC), identity and access management (IAM), and zero trust models. These mechanisms are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the network.
Threat Control: The techniques for detecting and blocking malicious activities and behaviors on the network were also explored. Technologies such as intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), endpoint protection, and security orchestration automation and response (SOAR) were highlighted.

## Traffic Analysis Techniques
Flow Analysis and Packet Analysis: I delved into the two main techniques used in traffic analysis, each offering unique insights into network behavior and potential security threats.

## Practical Application
Simulated Scenarios: The room featured practical exercises simulating real-world scenarios, such as identifying and filtering malicious IP addresses and analyzing network traffic to find anomalies. These exercises were instrumental in reinforcing the theoretical knowledge with practical application.
Static Site Simulation: I applied the skills learned to simulate a traffic analysis operation on a static site, finding flags and demonstrating my understanding of traffic analysis in action.

## Conclusion
Reflecting on my journey through the "Traffic Analysis Essentials" room, I concluded that traffic analysis remains a critical skill for any security analyst aiming to detect and respond to advanced threats. The increasing reliance on cloud computing and security tools/services forces attackers to adapt their tactics, making traffic analysis even more relevant. As I move on to the "Network Security and Traffic Analysis" module, I am equipped with a solid foundation in network security and traffic analysis, ready to delve deeper into these crucial areas in cybersecurity.
