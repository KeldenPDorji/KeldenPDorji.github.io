# TryHackMe - Kenobi
Walkthrough on exploiting a Linux machine. Enumerate Samba for shares, manipulate a vulnerable version of proftpd and escalate your privileges with path variable manipulation
![alt text](../assets/kenobi.jpg)

## Task 1: Deploy the Vulnerable Machine
Ensure you're connected to our network and deploy the target machine. No answer is required for this step.

## Task 2: Enumerating Samba for Shares
From the initial scan results, we can see SMB is running on ports 129 and 445. SMB ports are often improperly secured, and anonymous login may be enabled, allowing anyone to view shares without authentication. Since SMB seems like a promising attack vector, we will start there.

Nmap has scripts for enumerating SMB shares, which we can use to gather more information about the target.

Use the following command:
    nmap -p 445 --script=smb-enum-shares,smb-enum-users 10.10.244.226

How many shares have been found?
3

From the results, we see an anonymous share with READ/WRITE access. We can use this to investigate further.

To connect to SMB shares on Linux, use the smbclient utility. Once connected, list the files on the share.

What is the name of the file you can see?
log.txt

We can directly view the contents of log.txt using the more command, but let's download all the files on the share to our system using smbget for learning purposes.

Once downloaded, examine the log.txt file to gather information.

The log file indicates that an SSH key was generated and stored on the target system. It also confirms an FTP server running on port 21, and some configurations disabling the WRITE and CHMOD commands.

What port is FTP running on?
21

## Task 3: Gain Initial Access with ProFtpd
From the Nmap scan, we know there's an FTP server running on the target using ProFtpd version 1.3.5. Confirm this by connecting to the port using Netcat to capture the banner.

What is the version?
1.3.5

Next, use Searchsploit to check for vulnerabilities in this version of ProFTPd.

How many exploits are there for the ProFTPd running?
4

Reviewing the results, we see vulnerabilities related to the mod_copy module, which allows remote commands to be run. The mod_copy module implements two functions:

    SITE CPFR: Selects a file to be copied
    SITE CPTO: Specifies the location to paste the copied file

No configuration was found to disable SITE_COPY, so we can use this module to copy files on the target.

Given that an SSH key for the user Kenobi was found in the logs, we can use mod_copy to move the SSH key to the /var directory, which is being served by NFS. Once done, mount the NFS directory and download the key.

We copied Kenobi's private key to the /var/tmp directory, which we can now access by mounting the NFS directory on our system.

Log in to the target system using SSH and the retrieved key to find the user flag.

What is Kenobiâ€™s user flag (/home/kenobi/user.txt)?

## Task 4: Privilege Escalation with Path Variable Manipulation
With a foothold on the system, the next step is to escalate privileges. One method is to exploit binaries with the SUID bit set, which allows executors to run the binary with the owner's privileges.

Search for binaries with the SUID bit set and owned by root:

    find / -type f -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -l {} + 2>/dev/null

What file looks particularly out of the ordinary?
/usr/bin/menu

Run the binary to see how many options appear.

How many options appear?
3

Using the strings command, we can find readable lines in the binary. We see curl being invoked without a full path, meaning the system uses the PATH variable to locate it. By creating a file named curl that spawns a shell, and placing its directory at the start of the PATH variable, we can trick the system into running our file with root privileges.

Copy the contents of /bin/bash into the curl file, set the correct permissions, and adjust the PATH variable. Running the /usr/bin/menu binary will now execute our shell as root.

What is the root flag (/root/root.txt)?

That concludes the tasks. Happy hacking!
