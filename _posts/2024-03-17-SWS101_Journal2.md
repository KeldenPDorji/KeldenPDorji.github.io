## Hack The Box: tier 0 and 1 (Exploring Network Scanning and Exploitation Techniques)
---

### Tier 0 Machines

### Meow:   
This target machine stresses the significance of VPN connections for secure and segregated testing environments. It makes use of nmap to discover ports, telnet access for remote management login, introducing network polling and service operation at its most basic level. The goals are to identify open ports, contact services, and receive flags; these are the first steps in penetration testing.

### Fawn:
 Fawn goes more deeply into FTP (File Transfer Protocol) services, and explains how one can use their anonymous login feature to exploit them. It emphasizes the need for understanding of service versions and potential dangers associated with anonymous FTP access. The task involves connecting as an anonymous user, listing the files and using the get command to download the flag file.

### Dancing:
This machine is an SMB machine meaning that it focusses on the Server Message Block a network file sharing that teaches on how to identify and exploit SMB services to access files without a password, and the importance of network communication models and potential vulnerabilities. The tasks include identifying the SMB service and accessing files. The machine is critical as it is considered one of the most fundamental skills in penetration testing.

### Redeemer:
Redeemer is one of the web enumeration and directory brute-forcing in that it aims at identifying and exploiting web application vulnerabilities. The machine includes the use of tools like gobuster for directory brute-forcing and teaches web application security and the techniques used to identify and exploit web vulnerabilities. The tasks include finding an admin login path and brute-forcing the login form.
