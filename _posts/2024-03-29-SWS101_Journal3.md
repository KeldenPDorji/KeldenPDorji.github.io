Day 1: Introduction to OWASP Top 10 2021

Today I began my work on the OWASP Top 10 2021 room of TryHackMe, which based on the list of most critical security risks to web applications according to the Open Web Application Security Project . The OWASP Top 10 2021 is the de facto standard in the field of web application security and it is important not only for developers and information security specialists, but for other computing professionals as well. The OWASP Top 10 2021 vulnerabilities are as follows: Broken Access Control, Cryptographic Failures, Injection, Insecure Design, Security Misconfiguration, Vulnerable and Outdated Components, Identification and Authentication Failures, Software and Data Integrity Failures, Security Logging and Monitoring Failures.

The OWASP Top 10 2021 lists the following vulnerabilities:

1. Broken Access Control
2. Cryptographic Failures
3. Injection
4. Insecure Design
5. Security Misconfiguration
6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
7. Identification and Authentication Failures
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

In the room, I expect to learn about each of these vulnerabilities in detail, including their root causes, potential impacts, and mitigation techniques.

Day 2: Broken Access Control

Today, I delved into the first vulnerability on the OWASP Top 10 2021 list: Broken Access Control. The vulnerability is caused by a lack of access control, where an application utilizes poor access control policies making it possible for wrong users to access sensitive data or functionality

As evidenced in the room, the access control flaws include the following:

- Missing or ineffective access control mechanisms
- Insecure direct object references (IDOR)
- Horizontal and vertical privilege escalation vulnerabilities

Another concept I learned from these lessons is that solid access control mechanisms should be installed. This includes enforcing the principle of least privilege, performing proper authorization checks and even avoiding the exposure of sensitive data or functionality via insecure direct object references.

Mitigation techniques covered included:

- Implementing centralized access control mechanisms
- Enforcing the principle of least privilege
- Performing proper authorization checks
- Avoiding exposure of sensitive data or functionality through insecure direct object references

Day 3: Cryptographic Failures

Today's focus was on the second vulnerability in the OWASP Top 10 2021: Cryptographic Failures. This vulnerability occurs when applications fail to properly protect sensitive data through appropriate cryptographic measures.

The room covered various cryptographic failures, including:

- Insecure encryption algorithms
- Weak or default cryptographic keys
- Improper key management
- Insecure data transmission

One of the most important lessons I learned is that the use of robust and high-quality encryption algorithms, ensuring proper control over cryptographic keys, and effective data transmission channels by means of protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) is indispensable. 

Mitigation techniques included:

- Using strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms
- Proper key management practices
- Implementing secure data transmission mechanisms (e.g., TLS)
- Avoiding insecure cryptographic algorithms and protocols

[Continue in this format, covering each vulnerability in detail, including examples, impacts, and mitigation techniques.]

Day 4: Injection

Today's topic was Injection vulnerabilities, which occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query, leading to unintended execution or data manipulation.

The room covered various types of injection flaws, including:

- SQL Injection
- NoSQL Injection
- OS Command Injection
- XML External Entity (XXE) Injection

I learned about the threats associated with vulnerabilities, such as data breaches, data loss, and system takeover. In addition to that, injection risks were also discussed through an advisory that outlined the necessary measures to be taken as follows:

- Input validation and sanitization
- Parameterized queries
- Principle of least privilege
- Disabling unnecessary features (e.g., XML external entity processing)

Day 5: Insecure Design

Today's focus was on Insecure Design, which refers to flaws in the design and architecture of an application that can lead to security vulnerabilities.

Based on the development and design of security programs, as well as secure coding practices and the use of a number of security principles, including least privilege, defense in depth, and secure defaults, the training room teaches the significance of considering security from an initial design stage.

Mitigation techniques covered included:

- Threat modeling and secure design practices
- Secure coding principles
- Adherence to security principles (least privilege, defense in depth, secure defaults)
- Secure software development life cycle (SDLC)

Day 6: Security Misconfiguration

Security Misconfiguration refers to the inappropriate configuration of applications, servers, or databases, which leads to weaknesses and unauthorized access.

The room covered various types of security misconfigurations, such as:

- Insecure default configurations
- Unnecessary features or services enabled
- Insecure file permissions
- Lack of security headers

Mitigation techniques included:

- Secure installation and configuration processes
- Disabling unnecessary features and services
- Secure file permissions and access controls
- Implementing security headers

Day 7: Vulnerable and Outdated Components

In today's discussion, we tackled the issue of Vulnerable and Outdated Components. It is a term that relates to the utilization of outdated or vulnerable software components in applications.

The room emphasized the importance of keeping software components up-to-date and patched, as well as managing dependencies and third-party libraries effectively.

Mitigation techniques covered included:

- Software and dependency management processes
- Regular vulnerability scanning and patching
- Secure software supply chain practices
- Removing or upgrading vulnerable components

Day 8: Identification and Authentication Failures

Identification and Authentication Failures refer to flaws in the authentication and session management mechanisms of an application, which can lead to unauthorized access or account compromise.

The room covered various authentication vulnerabilities, such as:

- Weak or default credentials
- Insecure password recovery mechanisms
- Insecure session management
- Lack of multi-factor authentication

Mitigation techniques included:

- Strong password policies and password hashing
- Multi-factor authentication
- Secure session management
- Secure password recovery mechanisms

Day 9: Software and Data Integrity Failures

Today's spotlight shone on the pitfalls of Software and Data Integrity Flaws, highlighting the frailties that shake the core of software elements or data soundness. 

The chamber discussed various flaws in integrity, including: 

- Unsafe routines for updating or deploying code 
- Lack of code integrity checks
- Data tampering or corruption

Countermeasures embraced: 

- Guarded procedures for code deployment and updates 
- Verifications of code purity (like digital endorsements, signing of codes) 
- Safeguards and checks to ensure data authenticity 

Day 10: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

The ultimate fragility under scrutiny in OWASP Top 10 2021 was dubbed Security Logging and Watching Weaknesses, pointing at the insufficient mechanisms in applications dedicated to logging and oversight. 

The room emphasized the importance of logging and monitoring for detecting and responding to security incidents, as well as for compliance and auditing purposes.

Mitigation techniques covered included:

- Implementing comprehensive logging and monitoring mechanisms
- Secure log storage and protection
- Effective log analysis and incident response processes
- Monitoring for security events and anomalies

Day 11: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

The last topic in the room was Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), a vulnerability that allows an attacker to force the server to make requests to arbitrary systems or resources, potentially exposing sensitive information or enabling attacks on internal systems.

The room covered the risks associated with SSRF vulnerabilities, such as:

- Exposure of sensitive data from internal systems
- Lateral movement within the network
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks

Mitigation techniques included:

- Input validation and sanitization
- Whitelisting allowed URLs or IP addresses
- Disabling unnecessary URL redirection functionality
- Restricting outbound traffic to trusted destinations

I must say that in completing the OWASP Top 10 2021 TryHackMe room, I have been able to gain in-depth knowledge of the most severe risks that web application security experiences. Therefore, security can only be enhanced by addressing these vulnerabilities with secure coding principles, appropriate configuration, and suitable security controls.
